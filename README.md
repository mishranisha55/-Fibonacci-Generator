# -Fibonacci-Generator
I developed a Python script that allows users to generate Fibonacci sequences in two ways: 1. Up to a specific value: The program generates Fibonacci numbers until they exceed a user-defined limit.  2. Fixed number of terms: The program generates a specified number of Fibonacci numbers, even handling large values efficiently!
